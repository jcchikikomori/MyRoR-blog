## MyRoR Prototype - Blog Site

Based on this [RoR Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY1HCqe9MBc)

### How to setup?

- `$ bundle install`

### Warning for Windows

Some functions may not work on your machine with your installed RoR bundled packages (such as RubyInstaller, RailsInstaller, etc.)
So try some other OS (Linux/UNIX-based systems is my recommendation)
